Requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api). <br/>
Optionally requires [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli-fabric) to view the guidebook.<br/><br/>

### Getting Started
You can obtain the **guidebook** *(only if [Patchouli](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/patchouli-fabric) is installed)* for the mod by trading with a **technician** villager (distinguished by its red-and-blue glasses and headset, job site is a **Radio Jukebox**), or from the creative inventory. The **guidebook** will explain in detail the functionality behind every feature. <br/>
#### To set up your first *sound system*:
![Simple sound system](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43485105/147380181-ace9db36-978a-4a96-8744-afd424013daf.png)
On the left is a **Radio Jukebox**. This block broadcasts music disc audio to **Loudspeakers** on the same channel. You can change the channel by interacting with the top of the block. <br/>
On the right are a series of **Loudspeakers**, all tuned to the same channel as the jukebox. They are receiving audio from the **Radio Jukebox** and playing it. All of the components are tuned to channel `3`. There are **20** channels (`0`-`19`) to choose from, per dimension. <br/> <br/>
Some other available components are:
- **Radio Note Blocks**, which work like normal note blocks, but are able to send their audio to **Loudspeakers**.
- **Channel Tuners**, items that can set any radio component to a specific channel.
- **Note Block Tuners**, items that can copy, adjust, and set the note of any note block or **Radio Note Block**.
- **Boomboxes**, which work like **Loudspeakers** with the added benefit of playing audio when held.
